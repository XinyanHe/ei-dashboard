# ei-dashboard

This is a monitoring dashboard for extensible internet, it is implemented as a POX component module https://github.com/MurphyMc/pox. This dashbaord also requires an web component to start running

The current dashboard contains two part, the first one is the per-component console logs. The second one is the information generated by trees, including Config, ServiceModules and Pipes

To get the per-component console logs, you could simple put `web` and `ei-dashboard` behind the component you want to get logs for. Currently it
only displays the logs onto the dashboard screen but didn't apply any filters to it, I am currently working on filtering out the health information for SNM and Pipe

I have uploaded the script as the example to run the dashboard. You could put `web` and `ei-dashboard` behind the component you want to get console logs


Use Example:
1. Download `ei-dashboard` under the `ext` folder, and put the files udner `scripts` folder into `ext/ei/scripts/`

2. Launch SNs and Pipes with scripts Emily send previously, which is under `scripts` folder. Run the following command in seperate window under `pox` folder
    ```sh
    ext/ei/scripts/for_xinyan_start_eiip.sh 1 1
    ```
    ```sh
    ext/ei/scripts/for_xinyan_start_eiip2.sh 1 2
    ```

3. The dashboard should be available under http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/

4. In the script I put `ei-dashboard` component when lauching snm, you should be able to see the logs associated with it

5. You could click each button to get the relative information tree, currently you should be able to view Config, ServiceModules and Pipes trees
